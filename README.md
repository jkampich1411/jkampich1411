### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jakob aka. theJakobcraft!
I love coding!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Discord Bot!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++;<br>
But<br>
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with it, because I can't learn for school and C++ simultaneously.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love pizza and spaghetti, and I'm actually on 6th Grade.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [`At my organisation's eMail`](mailto:info@thejakobcraft.xyz).
<br>
But now,<br>

### Happy Coding!
